# Movie Recommender System ðŸŽ¬

A Movie Recommender System built using `Streamlit` that suggests movies based on user input. The system uses a similarity matrix to find and recommend movies similar to the selected one and displays movie posters using The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

## Problem Statement
This project aims to build a simple movie recommendation system that provides users with suggestions based on similarity. The recommendations are made by calculating similarity scores between movies using a pre-trained model. Additionally, the system fetches and displays movie posters to improve user experience.

## Skills and Libraries Used
- **Streamlit**: To build the interactive web application.
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pickle**: To load pre-trained model data.
- **Requests**: To fetch movie posters using TMDb API.
- **Base64**: To encode the background image for the application.
- **Pandas**: To handle movie dataset.
